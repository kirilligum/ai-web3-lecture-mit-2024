## Missing for Ideal AI Web3
- **Peer-Reviewed Data**:
  - High-quality data is essential.
- **Efficient GPU Rollup**:
  - On-chain AI remains expensive (e.g., Ora, Cartesi).
- **Potential Applications**:
  - AI voting (DAO delegates).
  - Attestation (paying authors for data, protecting artists' rights).

---

## Value of Modern AI
- **Abilities**:
  - Access to knowledge and analysis.
  - Planning, judging, evaluating.
  - Creativity and concept mixing.
  - Text and multimodal capabilities.
- **Impact**:
  - Replacing junior workers.
  - Writing and checking smart contracts.
  - Summarizing information, content generation, and chat.
  - Explaining Web3 and DevRel support.
- **Resources**:
  - Data, training compute, inference, and tools.

---

## Value of Blockchain
- **Core Features**:
  - Ideal centralized overseer.
  - Cloning ledgers for digital currency and security.
  - Privacy tech (e.g., zkML for AI privacy).
  - Cloning contracts for marketplaces and loans.
  - Managing communal ownership and tokenization.
  - Lower regulations and scalable infrastructure.

## AI x Web3
- **Shared Benefits**:
  - Transparency with optional privacy.
  - Micro and international payments.
  - Ownership, control, and dividends (DAOs).
- **Data**:
  - Peer-reviewed systems for high-quality data.
  - Licensing and attestation for creators.
- **Training**:
  - Pooling resources and trusted training.
  - Transparency and repeatability.

## Difficulties
- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Competitive on-chain inference is not yet feasible.
  - GPU rollups, zkML, and FHE are expensive.
  - TEE is vulnerable to attacks.
- **Data Creation**:
  - Needs expert input, not low-cost labor.
- **Attracting Talent**:
  - AI researchers prefer strong teams over higher pay.
- **Investment Challenges**:
  - AI investments are easier to secure than Web3.
  - Web3 requires incubators and token listings.
