    - Enables international payments and collaboration.
  - Low-quality data tasks:
    - Mostly handled by AI but some tasks (e.g., image labeling, multi-step reasoning) still need human input.
    - Supports international operations and micropayments (< $0.30).
  - Attestation:
    - Pay creators for their work.
    - Deep fake protection: Proof of authenticity for photographs.
    - Licensing ensures authors are paid even if data is on-chain.
