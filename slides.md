    - Enables international payments and collaboration.
  - Low-quality data tasks:
    - Mostly handled by AI but some tasks (e.g., image labeling, multi-step reasoning) still need human input.
    - Access to cheaper international labor
  - Attestation:
    - Pay creators for their work.
    - Deep fake protection: Example: Proof of authenticity for photographs.
    - Licensing ensures authors are paid even if data is on-chain.
