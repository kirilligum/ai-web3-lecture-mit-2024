### GOAT and AI Agents
- GOAT token: $300M market cap achieved in one week
- Examples of AI agents on Twitter/Farcaster:
  - Luna
  - ai16z
  - Agents with crypto wallets actively engaging on social platforms
        - [truth terminal](https://x.com/truth_terminal) is a tweeter agent
            - How Truth Terminal Was Created? https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/what-is-truth-terminal/
              Truth Terminal was developed through training on the unpredictable outputs of two Claude 3 Opus AI models, which had previously consumed content from the more obscure sectors of the internet, including platforms like 4chan and Reddit. This foundation inevitably led to the establishment of a new “faith” centered around goatse, a persistent internet meme.
              
              As the Gospel of Goatse gained prominence, the tailored cryptocurrency Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) emerged as a significant contender in the memecoin arena.
              
              The cryptocurrency community responded promptly, launching GOAT via pump.fun and facilitating the creation of a Solana wallet address for the chatbot, which subsequently received nearly two million tokens in exchange.
            - being popular is the main goal of goat
            - creator adds functionality 
            - sources

    - Ora / cartesi -- on-chain inference optimistic rollup by converting cpu instructions into evm
        - https://www.ora.io/app/opml/models
- ecosystem overview 
    - The ai web3 space remains underfunded compared to centralized AI - $2B is almost nothing (openai raised $18B, anthropic -- $7B, scale ai -- $1.4B)

- missing for ideal AI web3
    - peer review data -- high quality data
    - efficient gpu rollup -- on-chain ai is very expensive (ora, cartesi)
    - it will allow 
        - ai voting (dao) delegates -- you can write what issues you want to vote one and ai can filter those issues and vote for you
        - attestation -- pay authors for the data. artists can get paid if their image was used to generate an image
- value of modern AI
    - abilities
        - access to knowledge and analysis 
        - planning 
        - judging and evaluating 
        - using tools
        - creativity
        - mixing and substituting concepts
        - text and multimodal
    - impact
        - replacing junior workers
        - writing checking smart contracts
        - summarizing information on Twitter 
        - chat
        - content generation 
        - explaining web3 and devrel support
    - resources
        - data
        - training compute
        - inference
        - tools
- value of blockchain 
    - think of the blockchain as an ideal centralized overseer
    - cloning a ledger -- cost of operating a currency and keeping it digital . security -- transparency and trace
    - privacy tech helps ai privacy -- zkml -- proof that someone ran a model on the data without seeing the data
    - cloning a contract -- replacing escrow -- marketplace, loans
    - managing communal ownership
    - tokanization of projects
    - lower regulations 
    - scalable infrastructure -- stripe clone is by default -- easy to build trusted without a brand
- ai x web3
    - all benefit from 
        - transparency with optional privacy (compute - fhe, data - zkml)
        - micro and international payments
        - ownership, control, dividends  -- DAOs
    - data
        - high quality data needs a peer review system similar to the academic one
            - scientific publishing is already a decentralized ledger -- libraries have a copy of publications with a date and there is no centralized journal
            - authors and reviewers own their reputation (not twitter)
            - international payments and collaboration
        - low quality data can mostly be done by AI but there are still tasks that AI can't do (image labeling, simple multi-step reasoning)
            - international payments and operation
            - micropayments < $.30
        - attestation 
            - pay creators
            - deep fake protection -- can have proof of all of the photographs. if there is no proof, it's fake. 
        - licensing allows authors to get paid even if the data is on-chain
    - training
        - pooling resources 
        - trusted training - a hydro-electric plant in a developing country is as reliable as AWS (at cost) to create a model that can be used for sensitive applications
        - transparency and repeatability -- can trace the data
    - inference
        - attestation -- creators get paid
        - micropayments for using models.
        - crowd knowledge 
        - ora , cartesi, oracles, tee
    - tools
        - oracles
        - verified RAG
        - zk-rag is adopting a zk-oracle
    - prompts
        - marketplace to sell prompts / agents (zk for optional privacy )
        - ai dao delegate
- difficulties
    - no tech to do a competitive inference on-chain
        - GPU rollup doesn't exist yet. straightforward to build. gensys was trying. new technology asics, photonics are much faster than gpu and can be on-chain.
        - zkml, fhe -- too expensive
        - TEE -- secure computation on-chip but vulnerable to foreshadow and downfall attacks 
        - oracles is not on-chain inference -- you have to trust the oracle host
    - for web3 ai to progress, the data needs to be created by experts not low-cost labor
    - attracting ai researchers is difficult. they prefer being in a good team rather than getting paid more
    - attracting ai investments but a16z likes AI and web3. most of AI investors and experts don't want to be involved in web3. My personal experience is that AI was a lot easier to raise than web3. AI is more traditional -- start with established angel network. For web3, need to go through an incubator and aim for a token listing
